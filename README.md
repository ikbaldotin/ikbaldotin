## Hi there 👋

I’m Ikbal, a full-stack web developer from India.

I love building clean, fast, and practical web applications.
If an idea comes to mind, I usually jump in, explore it, and build something out of it.

My main tech stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind.
I’m currently learning AI tools and integrations, but I’m not working professionally with AI yet — just exploring and improving step by step.

I enjoy turning concepts into real projects, whether it’s a small UI component or a full-stack app.

Here you go — **converted into clean README-friendly Markdown** with proper formatting and spacing:

## 🚀 What I Build

* Full-stack web applications
* APIs and backend services
* Responsive UIs using React + Tailwind
* Clean, functional user experiences
* Side projects to learn new skills

---

## 😊 Fun Facts

* I like building more than planning
* I don’t depend on coffee — code is my fuel
* I explore new tech just for fun
* Hobbies: coding, learning, creating small projects
